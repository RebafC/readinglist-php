ReadingList
===========

ReadingList allows you to run your own collection of "urls to read". For example: you are reading a webpage and you want to mark it as "read later", the ReadingList service allows you to click on a bookmarklet and save the url into your own database, which generates an RSS feed from those urls.

You can import this RSS feed into your own, favorite RSS client (f.e. TinyTinyRSS)
